# Human tasks:
# - Regularly review and update the .gitignore file as new tools or build processes are introduced
# - Ensure that no sensitive information is accidentally committed by adding appropriate patterns
# - Consider using a global .gitignore file for developer-specific ignores
# - Add comments to explain the purpose of less obvious ignore patterns
# - Periodically clean up the repository of any files that should have been ignored
# - Educate team members on the importance of maintaining an up-to-date .gitignore file
# - Consider using gitignore templates for specific languages or frameworks as a starting point
