   - Communication Protocol: HTTPS
   - Authentication: API Key

4. Cloud Services API (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure)
   - Interface: REST API
   - Purpose: Infrastructure management, scaling, and monitoring
   - Data Format: JSON
   - Communication Protocol: HTTPS
   - Authentication: IAM or equivalent

### COMMUNICATION INTERFACES

The Code Skeptic Scanner will utilize the following communication interfaces:

1. HTTPS
   - Purpose: Secure communication for all external API interactions and user interface access
   - Protocol: TLS 1.3 or higher
   - Port: 443

2. WebSocket
   - Purpose: Real-time updates for the user interface
   - Protocol: WSS (WebSocket Secure)
   - Port: 443

3. SMTP
   - Purpose: Sending email notifications for critical alerts and reports
   - Protocol: SMTP with TLS
   - Port: 587 (or as configured by the email service provider)

4. DNS
   - Purpose: Domain name resolution for the web application and API endpoints
   - Protocol: DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for enhanced security
   - Port: 443

Data Formats:
- JSON: Primary data format for API communications and data storage
- CSV: Optional format for data exports and report generation
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For rendering the web-based user interface

Interaction Methods:
- RESTful API calls for most service-to-service communications
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for pushing real-time updates to the client
- WebSocket connections for bi-directional real-time communication where necessary
