```

The system operates as follows:

1. The Stream Monitoring Module continuously scans the Twitter API for relevant tweets based on customizable criteria.
2. Identified tweets are processed by the Data Extraction Module, which extracts key information and stores it in the Notion database.
3. The Sentiment Analysis Engine analyzes the tweet content to determine the level of skepticism or negativity.
4. For tweets meeting certain thresholds, the AI Response Generation Module creates contextually appropriate responses using LLM technology (e.g., GPT-4).
5. Generated responses are reviewed through the Human Review Interface before being posted back to Twitter.
6. All data is accessible through the User Interface and API, allowing for real-time monitoring, analysis, and system configuration.
7. The Analytics Engine processes the collected data to generate insights and trends, viewable through the Reporting Dashboard.

This system architecture ensures a seamless flow of data from initial tweet capture to response generation and analytics, providing a comprehensive tool for monitoring and engaging with AI coding tool skepticism on Twitter.

Key technologies and frameworks used in the system include:

- Cloud Infrastructure: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
- Database: Notion API for primary data storage
- Language Model: OpenAI's GPT-4 or equivalent for response generation
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Frontend: React.js for the user interface
- API: RESTful architecture with OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Real-time Communication: WebSockets for live updates
- Data Processing: Apache Spark for large-scale data analysis
- Monitoring and Logging: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

The Code Skeptic Scanner is designed to be highly configurable, allowing users to adjust parameters such as popularity thresholds, sentiment analysis sensitivity, and response generation guidelines. This flexibility ensures that the system can adapt to changing needs and market conditions.

By providing these capabilities, the Code Skeptic Scanner empowers AI coding tool companies to effectively monitor public sentiment, engage with their audience, and make data-driven decisions to improve their products and market positioning.

## SYSTEM DESIGN

### PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

The Code Skeptic Scanner will utilize the following programming languages, chosen for their suitability to the project requirements, ecosystem support, and team expertise:

| Language | Purpose | Justification |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| JavaScript (Node.js) | Backend development | - Excellent for real-time applications<br>- Rich ecosystem of libraries<br>- Asynchronous nature suits API-heavy operations<br>- Consistent language across frontend and backend |
| TypeScript | Backend type safety | - Adds static typing to JavaScript<br>- Improves code maintainability and reduces runtime errors<br>- Enhances developer productivity with better tooling support |

| SQL | Database queries | - Standard language for relational database operations<br>- Used for complex queries and data analysis within the cloud database |

### DATABASE DESIGN

The Code Skeptic Scanner will primarily use Notion as its database, leveraging its flexible structure and API capabilities. However, we will also utilize a cloud-based relational database for certain performance-critical operations and data that requires more structured storage.

Notion Database Structure:

1. Tweets Table
   - Properties: ID (Primary Key), Account Handle, Followers, Likes, Date and Time, Tweet Content, Media URL, Quoted Tweet ID, Doubt Rating, AI Tools Mentioned

2. Responses Table
   - Properties: ID (Primary Key), Tweet ID (Foreign Key), Response Content, Generated At, Approved Status

3. AI Tools Table
   - Properties: ID (Primary Key), Tool Name, Description

4. Custom Prompts Table
   - Properties: ID (Primary Key), Prompt Name, Prompt Content, Created At, Last Used

Cloud Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL on AWS RDS):

```mermaid
erDiagram
    TWEETS ||--o{ RESPONSES : generates
    TWEETS {
        string id PK
        string account_handle
        int followers
        int likes
        datetime timestamp
        string content_hash
        int doubt_rating
    }
    TWEETS ||--o{ TWEET_AI_TOOL_MENTIONS : mentions
    AI_TOOLS ||--o{ TWEET_AI_TOOL_MENTIONS : mentioned_in
    AI_TOOLS {
        string id PK
        string name
        string description
    }
    RESPONSES {
        string id PK
        string tweet_id FK
        string content_hash
        datetime generated_at
        boolean approved
    }
    TWEET_AI_TOOL_MENTIONS {
        string tweet_id FK
        string ai_tool_id FK
    }
    USER_ACCOUNTS ||--o{ RESPONSES : approves
    USER_ACCOUNTS {
        string id PK
        string username
        string email
        string role
    }
```

This hybrid approach allows us to leverage Notion's flexibility for most operations while using a relational database for performance-critical queries and data integrity constraints.

### API DESIGN

The Code Skeptic Scanner will expose a RESTful API for internal communication between services and for external integrations. The API will be designed following OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications.

   - Passwords will be hashed using bcrypt with a minimum work factor of 12.
   - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used for maintaining user sessions, with a short expiration time (15 minutes) and secure refresh token mechanism.

2. Authorization:
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will be implemented to manage user permissions.
   - The following roles will be defined:

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Admin | System administrator | Full access to all features and configuration settings |
| Manager | Team lead or project manager | Access to all data and response management features, limited configuration access |
| Analyst | Data analyst or researcher | Read access to all data, ability to generate reports and analyze trends |
| Responder | Community manager or support staff | Ability to review and post responses, limited data access |
| Viewer | Stakeholder or read-only user | Read-only access to dashboards and reports |

3. API Security:
   - API access will be secured using OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow for service-to-service communication.
   - Rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse of API endpoints.
   - API keys will be used for external integrations, with the ability to revoke or rotate keys as needed.

### DATA SECURITY

The Code Skeptic Scanner will implement comprehensive data security measures to protect sensitive information throughout its lifecycle.

1. Data Encryption:
   - All data at rest will be encrypted using AES-256 encryption.
   - Data in transit will be protected using TLS 1.3 or higher.
   - Database encryption will be enabled for the Notion database and any additional cloud databases used.

2. Data Classification:
   - A data classification system will be implemented to categorize information based on sensitivity:

| Classification | Description | Examples | Security Measures |
|----------------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Public | Non-sensitive, publicly available | Published tweets, public user profiles | No additional measures |
| Internal | Not for public, but not sensitive | Aggregated analytics, non-personal trends | Access control, encryption at rest |
| Confidential | Sensitive business data | Custom prompts, response strategies | Strong access control, encryption, audit logging |
| Restricted | Highly sensitive, personal data | User account details, unpublished responses | Strict access control, encryption, anonymization where possible |

3. Data Anonymization and Pseudonymization:
   - Personal data will be anonymized or pseudonymized where possible, especially for analytics and reporting purposes.
   - Data minimization principles will be applied to collect and store only necessary information.

4. Secure Data Deletion:
